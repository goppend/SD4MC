# SD4MC
An SD2SIO clone using (currently) available parts. A weekend project to keep myself busy while I'm waiting for parts and boards to arrive. :)

The SD2SIO/MX4SIO is an adapter for the Playstation 2, allowing the use of removable micro SD card in lieu of a memory card.
It allows applications or backups to be ran on softmodded PS2 hardware, so a Free MC Boot memory card is required.

To learn more about the history of this project and how to use it, discussion threads are on [psx-place.com](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/sio2sd-sd-card-adapter-and-sd-driver-for-the-ps2-sio2-interface.29210/), [trisaster.de](https://psxtools.de/index.php/Thread/81784-Ein-SD-Adapter-f%C3%BCr-den-MemoryCard-Anschluss-der-PS2/), and [psx-tools.de](http://www.trisaster.de/forum/index.php?topic=8324.0).

Thanks to Takeshi and many others at psx-place.com for the initial design and inspiration to create this.
